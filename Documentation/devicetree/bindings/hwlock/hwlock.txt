Generic hwlock bindings
=======================

Generic bindings that are common to all the hwlock platform specific driver
implementations, the retrieved values are used for registering the device
specific parameters with the hwspinlock core.

The validity and need of these common properties may vary from one platform
implementation to another. The platform specific bindings should explicitly
state if a property is mandatory or optional. Please look through the
individual platform specific hwlock binding documentations for identifying
the applicable properties.

Common properties:
- #hwlock-cells:	Specifies the number of cells needed to represent a
			specific lock.
- hwlock-num-locks:	Number of locks present in a hwlock device. This
			property is needed on hwlock devices, where the number
			of supported locks within a hwlock device cannot be
			read from a register.

Hwlock Users:
=============

Nodes that require specific hwlock(s) should specify them using one or more
properties, each containing a phandle to the hwlock node and an args specifier
value as indicated by #hwlock-cells. Multiple hwlocks can be requested using
an array of the phandle and hwlock number specifier tuple.

1. Example of a node using a single specific hwlock:

The following example has a node requesting a hwlock in the bank defined by
the node hwlock1. hwlock1 is a hwlock provider with an argument specifier
of length 1.

	node {
		...
		hwlocks = <&hwlock1 2>;
		...
	};

2. Example of a node using multiple specific hwlocks:

The following example has a node requesting two hwlocks, a hwlock within
the hwlock device node 'hwlock1' with #hwlock-cells value of 1, and another
hwlock within the hwlock device node 'hwlock2' with #hwlock-cells value of 2.

	node {
		...
		hwlocks = <&hwlock1 2>, <&hwlock2 0 3>;
		...
	};

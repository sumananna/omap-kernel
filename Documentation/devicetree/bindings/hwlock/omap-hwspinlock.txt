OMAP4+ HwSpinlock Driver
========================

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be "ti,omap4-hwspinlock" for
			    OMAP44xx, OMAP54xx, AM33xx, AM43xx, DRA7xx SoCs
- reg:			Contains the hwspinlock module register address space
			(base address and length)
- ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated with the hwspinlock device
- hwlock-base-id:	Should be 0 for the first IP block instance, or a proper
			positive value for any subsequent instance (if present)
			of the IP block.
- #hwlock-cells:	Should be 1. The OMAP hwspinlock users will use a
			0-indexed relative hwlock number as the argument
			specifier value for requesting a specific hwspinlock
			within a hwspinlock bank.


Example:

/* OMAP4 */
hwspinlock: spinlock@4a0f6000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-hwspinlock";
	reg = <0x4a0f6000 0x1000>;
	ti,hwmods = "spinlock";
	hwlock-base-id = <0>;
	#hwlock-cells = <1>;
};
